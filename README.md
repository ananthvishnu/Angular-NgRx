# NgRx Overview

NgRx is a state management library for Angular applications that helps you manage complex application state in a predictable and scalable way. It's based on the principles of Redux and provides a consistent pattern for handling state, actions, and side effects.

## Core Concepts

### Store

The **Store** is the central data store that holds your application's state. It's a single JavaScript object that represents the entire application's data.

### Actions

**Actions** are plain objects that describe events or intentions in your application. They have a type and can carry optional payload data. Actions are dispatched to the store to trigger state changes.

### Reducers

**Reducers** are pure functions that specify how your application's state changes in response to dispatched actions. They take the current state and an action as input and return a new state object.

### Selectors

**Selectors** are functions that retrieve specific slices of state from the store. They help you encapsulate logic for accessing and transforming state data. Selectors are used in components to get the data they need.

### Effects

**Effects** are used to manage side effects, such as asynchronous operations. They listen for specific actions, perform tasks like HTTP requests, and then dispatch new actions to update the state.

### Entities

The `@ngrx/entity` library provides tools for working with normalized data structures in the store. It simplifies managing collections of entities, like lists of items.

## Workflow

1. **Define Actions**: Create action types and action creators to represent events in your app.

2. **Create Reducers**: Write reducer functions to handle each action type. Reducers update the state based on actions.

3. **Define Selectors**: Create selectors to extract specific state from the store. You can also transform data using selectors.

4. **Implement Effects**: Set up effects to handle asynchronous operations and side effects.

5. **Dispatch Actions**: In components or services, dispatch actions to trigger state changes.

6. **Connect Components**: Use selectors to get state data and display it in your components. Dispatch actions based on user interactions.

## Benefits

- Predictable state management.
- Improved maintainability and testability.
- Scalability for complex apps.
- Clear separation of concerns.

## Installation

To start using NgRx in your Angular project, follow these steps:

1. Install NgRx packages:
   ```bash
   npm install @ngrx/store @ngrx/effects @ngrx/entity
